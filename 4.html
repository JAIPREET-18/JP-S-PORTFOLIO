   <h5>Introduction to web development:</h5>
   <p>Web development is the dynamic and multifaceted process of building, creating, and maintaining websites or web applications that are accessible over the internet. It encompasses a range of tasks, from designing the visual layout and user interface to programming the functionality that powers the interactive features.
    </p>
    <h5></h5>More about web development:</h5>
    <p>Front-End Development:
        Front-end development involves crafting the visible part of a website that users interact with directly. This includes designing the user interface (UI) and implementing it using languages such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. Front-end developers aim to create visually appealing and responsive websites that offer a seamless user experience.<br>
        Back-End Development:
        Back-end development focuses on the server-side of web applications, handling data storage, processing, and ensuring the overall functionality of the website. Back-end developers work with server-side languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Node.js, or Java, and interact with databases to manage and retrieve information.<br>
        Full-Stack Development:
        Full-stack developers are proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies, allowing them to handle the entire web development process. They can design the user interface, implement the functionality, and manage server-side operations, providing a comprehensive approach to web development.<br>
        Web Technologies:
        Web development leverages various technologies and frameworks. Popular front-end frameworks include React, Angular, and Vue.js, while back-end frameworks like Express.js (Node.js), Django (Python), Ruby on Rails, and Laravel (PHP) streamline server-side development.<br>
        Database Management:
        Database management is crucial for storing and retrieving data in web applications. Common databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite, each suited to different types of applications and data structures.
